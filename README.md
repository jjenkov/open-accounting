# open-accounting

Open accounting is a set of Java tools and JSON formats that can create accounting reports for small companies.

I created these tools and file formats because I am tired of the closed databases used by the popular accounting
software. Closed databases makes it hard to migrate to other tools. These tools will use a "repository" with files
as database, to make it easier to "migrate" to a new tool or generate another report with another tool etc.



Open accounting plans to have features for:


1) Linking bank account movements to receipts - both in data file and the real file.

2) Generating invoices

3) Generating account listings.


etc.


This is not intended to be a replacement for an ERP. Rather, it is intended to be an open collection of tools
working on an open set of JSON file formats. So far the tools are command line tools and the output is HTML reports.
But - who knows - in the future we might be able to create a GUI for the repo - just like GUIs for Git repos.

Let's make accounting easier and cheaper for small businesses.
