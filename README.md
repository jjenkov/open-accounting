# open-accounting

Open accounting is a set of Java tools and JSON formats that can create accounting reports for small companies.

Open accounting plans to have features for:


1) Linking bank account movements to receipts - both in data file and the real file.

2) Generating invoices

3) Generating account listings.


etc.


This is not intended to be a replacement for an ERP. Rather, it is intended to be an open collection of tools
working on an open set of JSON file formats. The tools are command line tools. The output is HTML reports.
Let's make accounting easier for small businesses.
